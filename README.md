We have a problem statement to help visually impaired students study. So, there are three types of visually impaired students: 1)low vision, 2)tunnel vision, 3)total blindness. For people who have low vision, the solution is not so complex; we need to filter out and select a few colours so that they can see better to improve the quality of their study remotely. For the Tunnel vision, we have to maintain some specific layouts as they can only focus on the centre of the screen and edges so every piece of important information should be shown typically in the centre or at the edges of the screen which can be customised. For the students who have Total blindness, we have to use a complex Natural Language processing Model whcih converts every piece of information like text, diagram, calculation to voice and is also able to react of the inputs that are vocally said by the totally blind-visioned people. We are also implementing playful quizzes for the totally blind, using vocal NLP models to make it fun for the students to study.
